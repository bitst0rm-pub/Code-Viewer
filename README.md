# Code Viewer

Code Viewer is a syntax highlighting extension for Google Chrome.<br/>
It is stalled here because i do not have a [developer account](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish#pay-the-developer-signup-fee) to publish it on Chrome Web Store.

Features:

- Support more than 100 languages out of box
- Support full search
- Support permanent ON/OFF (by clicking on the icon)
- Support active line highlighting
- Option to adjust line height
- Theme schedules mode (useful to auto switching themes between day/night)
- Blacklist file types
- Import and Export settings
- Work offline unlike 98% extensions on Chrome Web Store that call home and track you
